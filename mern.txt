jQuery (library)


React  is built on the idea of components - modularized parts of a website that are broken up in order to achieve a more organized code base. (library)

Angular (framework) takes control of how you structure your web app by creating a folder structure out of the bag, and you can use to CLI to quickly scaffold new components. 

lso works using components like React, but uses Typescript

DOM: document object model
CLI: command line interface
JSX: java script xml
ES6: ECMAJavascript 

JavaScript is run runs one command at a time through the event loop which is a specalized queue that allows Js  to add new operations when events happen while pther operations are already running

***JavaScript is the language, ECMAScript is the standard.

let allows for reassignment
const is immutable (must assign a value at creation and that value may not change for the life of the variable.)

Js interpreter breaks that down into two steps (parses the code & runs the code)

Key Rules of Hoisting
• Variable declarations (var) rise to the top of their scope like hot air balloons.

• Functions create their own scope and act like cages, preventing declarations from rising out.

• Assignments, or = signs, act like anchors. They stay put, no matter how the code is rearranged.

• let and const do not get hoisted,  and will throw an error if called before they are declared. const will even throw a syntax error if it is called before it is assigned.
